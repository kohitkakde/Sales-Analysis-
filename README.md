## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: Utilized for crafting dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide actionable business insights and enhance data storytelling.
- **Excel**: Employed for meticulous data preprocessing and initial analysis, ensuring data accuracy and integrity before visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Leveraged for creating sophisticated measures and calculated columns, enabling complex data transformations and in-depth analysis.

## üìÇ Data Source

Source: Data is provided in a separate folder named dataset.

## üîç Project Insight

- **Payment Methods**: Payments are predominantly made using cash on delivery (COD) and to a lesser extent, by card. Introducing incentives for card payments can boost the usage of cards.
- **Regional Sales**: The western region accounts for 1/3 of the total sales by region.
- **Product Analysis**: Phone sales are the highest, but copiers (0.72) have the highest profit margin among all subcategories.
- **Department Performance**: The technology department has the highest profit margin at 0.19, but the majority of the sales, amounting to $204,000, are from office supplies.
